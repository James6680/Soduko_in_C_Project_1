Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle game played on a 6x6 grid. The objective is to fill the grid so that each row, each column, and each of the six 2x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 6. Similar to the classic 9x9 Sudoku, the game starts with some cells pre-filled with numbers, and the player's task is to complete the grid by placing the remaining numbers without repeating any within the same row, column, or subgrid.

This variation of Sudoku offers a more compact challenge, suitable for those seeking a quicker gameplay experience or a fresh take on the traditional puzzle format. It still requires logical deduction and careful reasoning to solve efficiently.
